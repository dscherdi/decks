## What is the Pythagorean theorem?

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) equals the sum of squares of the other two sides (a and b).

The formula is: a² + b² = c²

This theorem is fundamental in geometry and has many practical applications.

$a^2+b^2=c^2$

| Stack | LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure |
| Queue | FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure |
| Hash Table | Key-value pairs with fast lookup using hash function |
| Tree | Hierarchical structure with root and child nodes |
| Graph | Collection of vertices connected by edges |
