# Math Basics Flashcards

This document contains basic mathematics flashcards for practice.

## What is the Pythagorean theorem?

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) equals the sum of squares of the other two sides (a and b).

The formula is: a² + b² = c²

This theorem is fundamental in geometry and has many practical applications.

$a^2+b^2=c^2$

## What is the quadratic formula?

The quadratic formula is used to solve quadratic equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.

The formula is: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

Where:
- a, b, and c are coefficients
- The ± symbol means there are typically two solutions
- The expression b² - 4ac is called the discriminant

## What is the derivative of x²?

The derivative of x² with respect to x is 2x.

This follows from the power rule: if f(x) = xⁿ, then f'(x) = n·xⁿ⁻¹

For x²: n = 2, so the derivative is 2·x¹ = 2x

## What is the area formula for a circle?

The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr²

Where:
- A is the area
- π (pi) is approximately 3.14159
- r is the radius of the circle

## What is the slope-intercept form of a linear equation?

The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is y = mx + b

Where:
- m is the slope of the line
- b is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)
- x and y are the coordinates of any point on the line

## What is the factorial of a number?

The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

For example:
- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
- 0! = 1 (by definition)
- n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1
