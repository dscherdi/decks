## TODO

1. ‚úÖ Update and Refresh Stats of the deck whenever the user reviews a flashcard
2. ‚úÖ Statistics modal
3. ‚úÖ Add a github style heatmap at the bottom left panel based on the reviews done per day
4. ‚úÖ Filter button on the decks table, to filter decks by name or tag.
5. ‚úÖ Background job that refreshes the side panel stats and data every 5 seconds
6. ‚úÖ Create a configuration page for each deck, which is reached by clicking on a cog icon on the row of the deck list. This configuration page should configure for a particular deck, the number of flashcards to review per session.
7. ‚úÖ Implement Anki-style daily limits for new cards and review cards with proper enforcement
8. ‚úÖ Review order of flashcard should be similar to anki, it should follow this order:
  1. Learning Cards
  	‚Ä¢	Cards currently in a learning or relearning state.
  	‚Ä¢	These always come first to ensure timely repetition within their interval.
  	‚Ä¢	Includes cards you've failed or just learned.
  2. Review Cards (Mature/Due)
  	‚Ä¢	Cards that are due based on spaced repetition.
  	‚Ä¢	Shown after all learning cards.
  	‚Ä¢	Their order is controlled by the deck option "Review order":
  	‚Ä¢	Oldest due first (default)
  	‚Ä¢	Random
  	‚Ä¢	Relative overdueness
  3. New Cards
  	‚Ä¢	Cards never reviewed before.
  	‚Ä¢	Shown after learning and review cards.
  	‚Ä¢	Their order is set by the deck option ‚ÄúNew card order‚Äù:
  	‚Ä¢	Order added (default, based on note ID)
  	‚Ä¢	Random
  	‚Ä¢	Due position
9. ‚úÖ Parse header-paragraph flashcards based on a configurable header level setting. The parser for header-paragraphs should parse only headers with that level and paragraphs it contains.
10. ‚úÖ Add a timelapsed to the review object which tracks how much time it took for the user to review a flashcard from the time it was shown to him until he chooses a difficulty. Use this timelapse in statistics to measure pace of the user seconds/cards.
