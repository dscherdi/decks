## TODO

1. ‚úÖ Update and Refresh Stats of the deck whenever the user reviews a flashcard
2. ‚úÖ Statistics modal
3. ‚úÖ Add a github style heatmap at the bottom left panel based on the reviews done per day
4. ‚úÖ Filter button on the decks table, to filter decks by name or tag.
5. ‚úÖ Background job that refreshes the side panel stats and data every 5 seconds
6. ‚úÖ Create a configuration page for each deck, which is reached by clicking on a cog icon on the row of the deck list. This configuration page should configure for a particular deck, the number of flashcards to review per session.
7. ‚úÖ Implement Anki-style daily limits for new cards and review cards with proper enforcement
8. ‚úÖ Review order of flashcard should be similar to anki, it should follow this order:
  1. Learning Cards
  	‚Ä¢	Cards currently in a learning or relearning state.
  	‚Ä¢	These always come first to ensure timely repetition within their interval.
  	‚Ä¢	Includes cards you've failed or just learned.
  2. Review Cards (Mature/Due)
  	‚Ä¢	Cards that are due based on spaced repetition.
  	‚Ä¢	Shown after all learning cards.
  	‚Ä¢	Their order is controlled by the deck option "Review order":
  	‚Ä¢	Oldest due first (default)
  	‚Ä¢	Random
  	‚Ä¢	Relative overdueness
  3. New Cards
  	‚Ä¢	Cards never reviewed before.
  	‚Ä¢	Shown after learning and review cards.
  	‚Ä¢	Their order is set by the deck option ‚ÄúNew card order‚Äù:
  	‚Ä¢	Order added (default, based on note ID)
  	‚Ä¢	Random
  	‚Ä¢	Due position
9. ‚úÖ Parse header-paragraph flashcards based on a configurable header level setting. The parser for header-paragraphs should parse only headers with that level and paragraphs it contains.
10. ‚úÖ Add a timelapsed to the review object which tracks how much time it took for the user to review a flashcard from the time it was shown to him until he chooses a difficulty. Use this timelapse in statistics to measure pace of the user seconds/cards.
11. ‚úÖ Mobile support:
  - The modals and views position and size must be adapted for mobile use.
12. ‚úÖ Export deck to anki:
  - A deck can be exported to anki by clicking on the cog icon of the deck, on the deck list.
  - The cog will open a select dropdown where the user can select the option Export to anki.
  - The select dropdown will contain these options:
    - Export to anki
    - Configure deck
  - The export to anki function opens a configuration modal where the user can select options for exporting to anki:
    - The note type
    - Tags the user would like to add to anki
    - Specific anki Deck

### ‚úÖ Todo 13 - Pure FSRS Implementation

**Successfully implemented Pure FSRS algorithm with the following changes:**

**‚úÖ Core Algorithm Changes:**
- Removed all step-based logic (getNewCardInterval, learningProgressionMultiplier, hardInterval, easyBonus)
- Simplified to only two states: "New" and "Review" (no Learning/Relearning states)
- Implemented pure FSRS initialization for new cards with all ratings going directly to Review state
- All intervals are now ‚â•1 day (minimum 1440 minutes) - no minute-based learning steps
- Proper FSRS state transitions: New ‚Üí Review (permanent)

**‚úÖ Data Model Updates:**
- Updated database schema to only allow "new" and "review" states
- Proper storage of stability, difficulty, reps, lapses, lastReviewed
- Legacy learning state cards are automatically migrated to review state
- Removed obsolete FSRS parameters from settings interface

**‚úÖ Algorithm Compliance:**
- getSchedulingInfo() returns four different futures without mutating original card
- updateCard() properly handles initialization vs subsequent reviews
- Maximum interval capping works correctly (36500 days)
- All ratings maintain monotonic interval progression (Hard < Good < Easy)
- Proper lapse counting and stability updates for Again ratings

**‚úÖ UI/UX Updates:**
- Removed Learning column from deck statistics displays
- Updated settings to remove obsolete parameters (easyBonus, hardInterval, etc.)
- Simplified deck configuration descriptions
- Hidden learning card references in statistics panels

**‚úÖ Testing & Verification:**
- Comprehensive test suite covering all pure FSRS requirements
- Migration support for existing cards with legacy states
- All edge cases and algorithm correctness verified
- Build and TypeScript compilation successful

The implementation now fully complies with pure FSRS specifications and passes all required sanity tests.


### ‚úÖ TODO 14: FSRS with subday schedules

Do all of the following to support sub‚Äëday intervals in your pure FSRS implementation.
	1.	Interval math

	‚Ä¢	Replace day-based function with minute-based:

private nextIntervalMinutes(stability: number): number {
  const k = Math.log(this.params.requestRetention) / Math.log(0.9); // < 0
  const minutes = stability * k * 1440; // may be < 1d
  const floor = this.params.minMinutes ?? 15;              // configurable, e.g., 10‚Äì30
  const cap   = (this.params.maximumInterval ?? 36500) * 1440;
  return Math.max(floor, Math.min(minutes, cap));
}

	‚Ä¢	Remove the ‚â•1‚Äëday clamp and any Math.round inside scheduling logic. Round only for display.

	2.	Parameters

	‚Ä¢	Extend FSRSParameters:

export interface FSRSParameters {
  w: number[];
  requestRetention: number;   // (0,1)
  maximumInterval: number;    // days
  minMinutes: number;         // e.g., 15
}

	‚Ä¢	Validate on set: 0.5 ‚â§ requestRetention ‚â§ 0.99, w.length===17, minMinutes ‚â• 1.

	3.	Elapsed time

	‚Ä¢	Keep fractional days; no rounding:

private getElapsedDays(last: Date, now: Date): number {
  return Math.max(0, (now.getTime() - last.getTime()) / 86400000);
}

	4.	Scheduling pipeline

	‚Ä¢	Preview:

private calculateScheduleForRating(card: FSRSCard, rating: number, now: Date): SchedulingCard {
  const updated = this.calculateUpdatedFsrsCard(card, rating, now); // updates S/D, reps, lapses, lastReview=now, state=Review
  const intervalMin = this.nextIntervalMinutes(updated.stability);
  return this.createSchedulingCard(intervalMin, updated, now);
}

	‚Ä¢	Update:
	‚Ä¢	Persist interval in minutes (float or int).
	‚Ä¢	Persist dueDate = now + intervalMinutes.
	‚Ä¢	Never reintroduce Learning/Relearning paths.

	5.	Storage schema

	‚Ä¢	Keep explicit FSRS fields; stop overloading:
	‚Ä¢	stability: number
	‚Ä¢	difficulty: number  // 1‚Äì10
	‚Ä¢	repetitions: number
	‚Ä¢	lapses: number
	‚Ä¢	lastReviewed: ISO string
	‚Ä¢	dueDate: ISO string
	‚Ä¢	interval: number    // minutes
	‚Ä¢	state: "new" | "review"
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Removed easeFactor completely - now using only difficulty field for FSRS.

	6.	Initialization (first rating)

	‚Ä¢	Unchanged conceptually; output can be sub‚Äëday:
	‚Ä¢	stability = initStability(r)
	‚Ä¢	difficulty = initDifficulty(r)
	‚Ä¢	reps=1
	‚Ä¢	lapses += (r===1)
	‚Ä¢	lastReview=now
	‚Ä¢	intervalMinutes = nextIntervalMinutes(stability)
	‚Ä¢	dueDate = now + intervalMinutes
	‚Ä¢	state="review"

	7.	UI/UX

	‚Ä¢	Deck counts: compute ‚ÄúDue‚Äù by dueDate <= now. No ‚ÄúLearn‚Äù bucket.
	‚Ä¢	Interval display already ok; ensure it prefers minutes/hours < 1 day.
	‚Ä¢	Show predicted intervals for the four buttons using getSchedulingInfo() with minute precision.

	8.	Queue/scheduler behavior

	‚Ä¢	Allow multiple appearances in the same day. The scheduling loop must check due items continuously or on user action; do not batch strictly by calendar day.
	‚Ä¢	Add per-session anti-thrash guard: never schedule below minMinutes. Optional soft limit on total appearances per day per card (e.g., ‚â§ 6) to avoid pathological loops.

	9.	Code removals

	‚Ä¢	Remove:
	‚Ä¢	Any >= 1440 graduation checks.
	‚Ä¢	Any minute-step logic (1m/6m/10m/4d).
	‚Ä¢	learningProgressionMultiplier, hardInterval, easyBonus, ‚Äúgraduating/easy interval‚Äù comments.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure FSRSState remains only "New" | "Review"; never set "Learning"/"Relearning".

	10.	Preview purity

	‚Ä¢	getSchedulingInfo() must not mutate stored cards. You already return a derived SchedulingCard; keep cloning and avoid side effects.

	11.	Rounding discipline

	‚Ä¢	Store canonical interval in minutes (integer). If you want exactness, store double and round for UI only.
	‚Ä¢	Never round stability/difficulty; store full precision.

	12.	Migration

	‚Ä¢	Existing cards:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Migration completed: easeFactor values copied to difficulty during schema migration.
	‚Ä¢	Keep stability if present. If missing, initialize on the next rating only; do not guess.
	‚Ä¢	Convert any day-based interval to minutes once, if you previously stored days.
	‚Ä¢	Backfill dueDate if null: now to force immediate review visibility.

	13.	Tests

	‚Ä¢	New card + Good:
	‚Ä¢	Produces interval ‚â• minMinutes, < 1 day for low initial stability if weights are tuned; state becomes Review.
	‚Ä¢	Review + Again:
	‚Ä¢	Increments lapses, reduces stability via FSRS update, returns interval ‚â• minMinutes and typically short (minutes/hours).
	‚Ä¢	Monotonic button order:
	‚Ä¢	For same state: Again < Hard < Good < Easy in minutes.
	‚Ä¢	Continuous-time correctness:
	‚Ä¢	With elapsedDays = 0.5, results differ from elapsedDays = 1.
	‚Ä¢	Cap and floor:
	‚Ä¢	Intervals never fall below minMinutes and never exceed maximumInterval*1440.

	14.	Optional tuning for sub‚Äëday starts

	‚Ä¢	Lower w[0..3] (initial stability after first rating) to target first intervals in minutes/hours:
	‚Ä¢	Again/Hard/Good/Easy stabilities ‚âà [20, 40, 120, 480] minutes √∑ 1440, adjusted by requestRetention.
	‚Ä¢	Raise requestRetention to 0.96‚Äì0.98 for tighter spacing near exams.

	15.	Defensive coding

	‚Ä¢	Guard invalid params; throw on w.length!==17 or requestRetention‚àâ(0,1).
	‚Ä¢	Clamp difficulty to [1,10] after updates; you already do.

Implement items 1‚Äì15, then remove any leftover references to day floors or step-based scheduling.

### TODO 15: FSRS config profiles

Implement deck‚Äëconfiguration profiles in FSRS settings. Produce TypeScript code and minimal schema changes. Enforce all constraints.

Scope
	‚Ä¢	Deck config FSRS section exposes:
	‚Ä¢	requestRetention: number in (0,1), default 0.90.
	‚Ä¢	profile: "INTENSIVE" | "STANDARD".
	‚Ä¢	Deck config FSRS section must NOT store FSRS weights, minMinutes, or maximumIntervalDays. These are hardcoded.
	‚Ä¢	Profiles:
  	‚Ä¢	INTENSIVE: pure FSRS from the first rating with fractional (minute) intervals all the way. Initial target intervals:
     	‚Ä¢	Again=1m, Hard=5m, Good=10m, Easy=40 min.
     	‚Ä¢	There are no steps; all spacing is FSRS‚Äëdriven with minute granularity thereafter.
  	‚Ä¢	STANDARD: pure FSRS, day‚Äëbased; minimum interval clamp = 1 day; no sub‚Äëday outputs.

FSRS internals (hardcoded, not user‚Äëeditable)
	‚Ä¢	FSRS_WEIGHTS_STANDARD = FSRS‚Äë4.5 weights.
	‚Ä¢	FSRS_WEIGHTS_SUBDAY: same as FSRS‚Äë4.5 except w0..w3 set to match the intensive targets in days:
	‚Ä¢	w0 = 1/1440, w1 = 5/1440, w2 = 10/1440, w3 = 40/1440.
	‚Ä¢	Note: first‚Äëinterval minutes scale by k = ln(requestRetention)/ln(0.9). With requestRetention=0.90, k=1. If user changes requestRetention, first intervals scale by k.
	‚Ä¢	Global clamps (hardcoded):
	‚Ä¢	maximumIntervalDays = 36500.
	‚Ä¢	minMinutes_INTENSIVE = 1.
	‚Ä¢	minMinutes_STANDARD = 1440 (i.e., 1 day).

Scheduling rules (both profiles)
	‚Ä¢	States: "new" ‚Üí first rating ‚Üí "review" permanently. No Learning/Relearning.
	‚Ä¢	At each rating:
	‚Ä¢	Compute elapsedDays = max(0, (now - lastReviewedAt)/86_400_000).
	‚Ä¢	R = (1 + elapsedDays/(9*S))^(-1).
	‚Ä¢	Update difficulty and stability via FSRS‚Äë4.5 equations (weights per profile‚Äôs hardcoded set).
	‚Ä¢	Compute next interval:

k = ln(requestRetention)/ln(0.9)
nextMinutes = clamp(minMinutes, maximumIntervalDays*1440, stability * k * 1440)


	‚Ä¢	dueAt = now + nextMinutes * 60_000.

	‚Ä¢	Profile differences:
	‚Ä¢	INTENSIVE: use FSRS_WEIGHTS_SUBDAY; minMinutes = 1.
	‚Ä¢	STANDARD: use FSRS_WEIGHTS_STANDARD; minMinutes = 1440.

Data model
	‚Ä¢	 DeckConfig.fsrs: { requestRetention: number, profile: "INTENSIVE"|"STANDARD" }.
	-    Reviewlog - store profile


API
	‚Ä¢	getDeckConfig(deckId) ‚Üí DeckConfig.
	‚Ä¢	updateDeckConfig(deckId, { requestRetention?, profile? }) with validation; changing profile does not retro‚Äëmutate existing card states.
	‚Ä¢	schedulePreview(cardId, now) returns four outcomes using the current deck‚Äôs profile rules, minute‚Äëgranularity.

Validation
	‚Ä¢	requestRetention ‚àà (0.5, 0.995); clamp or reject outside.
	‚Ä¢	profile ‚àà {"INTENSIVE","STANDARD"}.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure weights arrays have length 17; throw on misconfig.
	‚Ä¢	Clamp difficulty to [1,10], stability to ‚â• 1e‚Äë12.
	‚Ä¢	Store intervalMinutes as number; compute due by timestamp math (UTC). No calendar‚Äëday buckets.

Precision policy
	‚Ä¢	All FSRS math uses IEEE‚Äë754 doubles. No rounding inside logic. Round only in UI formatting.
	‚Ä¢	Keep stability, difficulty unrounded in storage.
	‚Ä¢	Intervals stored as minutes (float or int). Display rounding only.

Migration
	‚Ä¢	Drop any deck‚Äëlevel storage for weights/min/max intervals.
	‚Ä¢	Existing "new" cards follow the profile‚Äôs initialization on next review.
	‚Ä¢	Existing "review" cards keep their FSRS state; switching profile only changes which hardcoded weights and minMinutes are used on subsequent reviews.
	‚Ä¢	Backfill profileSnapshot on next review.

Tests
	‚Ä¢	INTENSIVE:
    	‚Ä¢	New+Again ‚áí ~1m (‚â•1m floor).
    	‚Ä¢	New+Good ‚áí ~10m.
    	‚Ä¢	Subsequent reviews produce continuous minute/hour growth; no step logic is ever invoked.
	‚Ä¢	STANDARD:
    	‚Ä¢	New+Good ‚áí ‚â•1 day; sub‚Äëday never produced.
    	‚Ä¢	Monotonicity per review: Again < Hard < Good < Easy for same card/time.
    	‚Ä¢	Changing requestRetention scales intervals by factor ln(rr)/ln(0.9); verify first‚Äëinterval scaling and subsequent growth.
    	‚Ä¢	Precision: after 100 updates, stability finite and positive; no unintended quantization.

#### Behaviour when the user changes profiles

Do this when a user switches profiles:
	1.	Persist the change

	‚Ä¢	Update deck config: profile, requestRetention, bump configVersion. No other fields.

	2.	Do not touch existing cards

	‚Ä¢	Do not reinitialize stability/difficulty.
	‚Ä¢	Do not rewrite dueAt or intervalMinutes.
	‚Ä¢	Do not rescale anything.

	3.	Apply new rules on the next review

	‚Ä¢	On each card‚Äôs next rating, use the new profile‚Äôs:
	‚Ä¢	weights (INTENSIVE=sub‚Äëday w0..w3; STANDARD=FSRS‚Äë4.5),
	‚Ä¢	minMinutes (INTENSIVE=1, STANDARD=1440),
	‚Ä¢	current requestRetention.
	‚Ä¢	Write profileSnapshot on the card to the new profile at that moment.
	‚Ä¢	Log the profile used in the review log row.

	4.	New cards after the switch

	‚Ä¢	Initialize with the new profile immediately.
	‚Ä¢	INTENSIVE: first intervals ~1m/5m/10m/40m (scaled by ln(rr)/ln(0.9)), minute granularity thereafter.
	‚Ä¢	STANDARD: first interval ‚â•1 day, day floor thereafter.

	5.	In‚Äëflight edge cases

	‚Ä¢	If switching to STANDARD while some cards are due in <1 day, keep their current dueAt; the day floor applies only after you answer them.
	‚Ä¢	If switching to INTENSIVE while some cards are due in many days, keep dueAt; minute granularity applies only after the next answer.

	6.	Preview/UI

	‚Ä¢	Recompute button previews immediately using the new profile for all cards (without mutating storage).
	‚Ä¢	Deck ‚ÄúDue‚Äù counts remain based on stored dueAt; they won‚Äôt jump on profile change.

	7.	Auditing

	‚Ä¢	Insert a profile_changed system log with deckId, oldProfile, newProfile, oldRR, newRR, configVersion, timestamp.
	‚Ä¢	Include profile, requestRetention, and weightsVersion in each subsequent ReviewLog.

	8.	Safety/validation

	‚Ä¢	Validate profile ‚àà {"INTENSIVE","STANDARD"} and 0.5 < requestRetention < 0.995.
	‚Ä¢	Scheduler must read profile and rr at rating time; never cache per‚Äësession beyond a single compute call.

This preserves card history, avoids retroactive rewrites, and cleanly switches behavior at the next interaction.

### TODO 16: Proper Migration

Use schema versioning, run ordered migrations inside a transaction, and rebuild tables when removing fields.

Procedure:
	1.	Versioning

	‚Ä¢	Store current schema version with PRAGMA user_version.
	‚Ä¢	Bump it after each successful migration.

	2.	Apply-once migration runner

	‚Ä¢	Keep an ordered list {from,to,up}.
	‚Ä¢	Read PRAGMA user_version; run all up where from === currentVersion.
	‚Ä¢	Wrap the entire step in a single transaction; rollback on error; only then PRAGMA user_version = to.

	3.	Adding a column (cheap)

	‚Ä¢	ALTER TABLE table ADD COLUMN new_col TYPE DEFAULT <value>;
	‚Ä¢	Backfill if needed with UPDATE.

	4.	Dropping or changing a column (rebuild)

	‚Ä¢	Create a new table with the desired shape.
	‚Ä¢	Copy only the columns you keep/transform.
	‚Ä¢	Swap names; recreate indexes/constraints; drop the old table.
	‚Ä¢	Pattern:

BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE new_table( ...desired columns... );
INSERT INTO new_table (c1, c2, c3)
  SELECT c1, c2, transform(c_old) AS c2, c3 FROM old_table;
DROP TABLE old_table;
ALTER TABLE new_table RENAME TO old_table;
CREATE INDEX ...; -- recreate
COMMIT;



	5.	Foreign keys and integrity

	‚Ä¢	PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF; before rebuild; ON; after.
	‚Ä¢	If you use them, also PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys = ON; inside the transaction.

	6.	Indices and triggers

	‚Ä¢	You must recreate them after rebuild; ALTER TABLE ... RENAME does not move them.

	7.	Vacuum (optional)

	‚Ä¢	After large rebuilds: VACUUM; to reclaim space.

	8.	Persistence

	‚Ä¢	In sql.js you must re-export the DB buffer after migration and persist it (IndexedDB or file).

Notes:
	‚Ä¢	sql.js has no WAL; transactions are still atomic within the in‚Äëmemory VM. Always export the DB bytes only after migrate() succeeds.
	‚Ä¢	For renames, SQLite supports ALTER TABLE t RENAME COLUMN old TO new in newer engines, but for maximum compatibility in sql.js, prefer rebuilds.
	‚Ä¢	Always recreate indexes and triggers after rebuilds.

### TODO 17: Database migration should be run one table at a time in a series of transactions

### ‚úÖ TODO 18: During a review session, all cards reviewed that are due will not be shown in this session until the next session.

**COMPLETED** - Implemented dynamic card reloading during review sessions without session-based locking.

**Implementation Summary:**
- **Dynamic Card List Refresh**: After each card review, the system refreshes the available card list to check for newly due cards
- **No Session Locking**: Reviewed cards are removed from the current list but can reappear when they become due again
- **Real-Time Due Checking**: Cards that reach their due time during the session are automatically added back
- **Profile Support**: Works for both INTENSIVE (sub-day intervals) and STANDARD (1+ day intervals) profiles
- **Seamless Experience**: Session continues as long as cards are available, respecting daily limits

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `FlashcardReviewModal.svelte` to refresh card list after each review
- Added `refreshCardList` prop to dynamically load newly due cards
- Updated `FlashcardReviewModalWrapper.ts` to pass card refresh function
- Enhanced session management to support continuous card flow without artificial session locks

**Behavior:**
- INTENSIVE: Cards with 1-10 minute intervals resurface in same session when due
- STANDARD: Cards with 1+ day intervals won't reappear same day (not due until next day)
- No "seen-this-session" filtering - purely time-based due checking


### ‚úÖ TODO 19: Mature cards are flashcards that have an interval over 21 days.

**COMPLETED** - Implemented proper mature card classification based on interval length.

**Implementation Summary:**
- **Definition**: Mature cards are review cards with intervals > 21 days (30,240 minutes)
- **Database Query Update**: Modified `GET_CARD_STATS` to classify cards as new/review/mature based on interval
- **Type System**: Added `isCardMature()` and `getCardMaturityType()` utility functions
- **Statistics Enhancement**: Updated CardStats interface to distinguish between review and mature cards
- **UI Updates**: Enhanced StatisticsUI to show separate counts for New, Review, and Mature cards
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added test suite with 12 test cases covering edge cases and real-world intervals

**Technical Changes:**
- Updated `schemas.ts`: Modified `GET_CARD_STATS` query to use `CASE WHEN f.interval > 30240` logic
- Updated `types.ts`: Added `review` field to `CardStats` interface and utility functions
- Updated `DatabaseService.ts`: Enhanced `getOverallStatistics()` to handle three card types
- Updated `StatisticsUI.svelte`: Added Review card display and fixed total/maturity calculations
- Added `mature-cards.test.ts`: Comprehensive test coverage for mature card classification

**Behavior:**
- **New Cards**: state = 'new' (regardless of interval)
- **Review Cards**: state = 'review' AND interval ‚â§ 21 days (30,240 minutes)
- **Mature Cards**: state = 'review' AND interval > 21 days (30,240 minutes)
- **Statistics**: Proper counts and maturity ratio calculation including all three categories

### ‚úÖ TODO 20: Scheduler implementation

Unify the logic of a scheduler split in multiple components (FlashcardsReviewModal, Main.ts, DatabaseService.ts, fsrs.ts, etc) into a new component Scheduler.ts


Definition: a scheduler is the deterministic component that, given the current time and each card‚Äôs memory state, decides which card to show next and when each card will be shown again.

The pseudocode in this description are meant as a guide (it may be missing things), make sure to check with current implementation and adapt accordingly.


Core responsibilities
	‚Ä¢	Select next due card.
	‚Ä¢	Update card state from a rating (Again/Hard/Good/Easy).
	‚Ä¢	Compute the next review time (dueAt) and interval.
	‚Ä¢	Maintain invariants across profiles and options.
	‚Ä¢	Persist changes atomically and idempotently.

The current implementation implements these responsibilities in different components, we need to find them and unify them in a Scheduler component

Inputs
	‚Ä¢	Now (UTC timestamp).
	‚Ä¢	Card state: {state, stability, difficulty, repetitions, lapses, lastReviewedAt, dueAt, intervalMinutes, deckId, profileSnapshot}.
	‚Ä¢	Deck config: {requestRetention, profile}.
	‚Ä¢	FSRS parameters: weights for the chosen profile, maximumIntervalDays, minMinutes (hardcoded, not user-editable).
	‚Ä¢	User action: rating ‚àà {1,2,3,4}.

Outputs
	‚Ä¢	Next card to present (or none).
	‚Ä¢	Updated card record after a rating.
	‚Ä¢	Review log entry.

Invariants
	‚Ä¢	Only two states: "new" and "review". First rating moves "new"‚Üí"review". Never demote.
	‚Ä¢	Intervals are minute-based; dueAt = lastReviewedAt + intervalMinutes.
	‚Ä¢	INTENSIVE profile allows sub-day intervals (minMinutes ‚â• 1). STANDARD clamps to ‚â• 1 day.
	‚Ä¢	Button order monotonic: Again < Hard < Good < Easy.
	‚Ä¢	No ‚Äúsession lockout‚Äù: a card can reappear in the same session when its dueAt arrives.

Queues
	‚Ä¢	Due queue: cards with dueAt <= now, ordered by dueAt ASC, then tie-breaker (e.g., oldest lastReviewedAt).
	‚Ä¢	Pending queue: empty by default; optionally for UI prefetch or filtered study modes.
	‚Ä¢	New queue: selection policy for unseen cards (respect daily new limits if you implement them).

Selection policy
	‚Ä¢	If any due cards exist: show the earliest dueAt.
	‚Ä¢	Else, if allowNew and new quota remains: pick next new card (deterministic ordering).
	‚Ä¢	Else: idle until next dueAt or end session.

Rating update
	‚Ä¢	Compute elapsedDays = max(0, (now - lastReviewedAt) / 86_400_000).
	‚Ä¢	Compute retrievability R = (1 + elapsedDays / (9 * stability))^(-1) (clamp stability > 0).
	‚Ä¢	Update difficulty:
d' = w7*w4 + (1-w7)*(d - w6*(rating-3)), clamp to [1,10].
	‚Ä¢	Update stability:
s' = s * (1 + exp(w8) * (11 - d') * s^(-w9) * (exp((1 - R) * w10) - 1) * hardPenalty(r) * easyBonus(r)), clamp > 0.
	‚Ä¢	Next interval (minutes):
k = ln(requestRetention)/ln(0.9),
minutes = clamp(minMinutes, maxDays*1440, s' * k * 1440).
	‚Ä¢	Persist:
	‚Ä¢	state="review"
	‚Ä¢	repetitions += 1
	‚Ä¢	lapses += (rating===1 ? 1 : 0)
	‚Ä¢	lastReviewedAt = now
	‚Ä¢	intervalMinutes = minutes
	‚Ä¢	dueAt = now + minutes*60_000
	‚Ä¢	profileSnapshot = deck.profile

Review logging (immutable)
	‚Ä¢	Store: cardId, reviewedAt, rating, elapsedDays, retrievability, old/new stability, old/new difficulty, old/new intervalMinutes, old/new dueAt, old/new repetitions, old/new lapses, old/new state, requestRetention, profile, weightsVersion, schedulerVersion.

Profile behavior
	‚Ä¢	INTENSIVE: use sub-day weights (w0..w3 encode first-interval targets like 1m/5m/10m/40m), minMinutes=1.
	‚Ä¢	STANDARD: use FSRS-4.5 weights, minMinutes=1440.
	‚Ä¢	Switching profiles affects only subsequent computations; do not mutate existing card fields immediately.

APIs
	‚Ä¢	getNext(now, deckId, options) ‚Üí Card | null
	‚Ä¢	preview(cardId, now) ‚Üí {again, hard, good, easy}: SchedulingCard (no mutations)
	‚Ä¢	rate(cardId, rating, now) ‚Üí UpdatedCard (mutates, logs review)
	‚Ä¢	peekDue(now, deckId, limit) ‚Üí Card[]
	‚Ä¢	timeToNext(now, deckId) ‚Üí milliseconds | null

Pseudocode

function getNext(now: Date, deckId: string): Card | null {
  const due = db.select(`
    SELECT * FROM cards
    WHERE deckId=? AND dueAt <= ?
    ORDER BY dueAt ASC, lastReviewedAt ASC
    LIMIT 1
  `, [deckId, now.toISOString()]);
  if (due) return due;

  if (allowNew(deckId)) {
    return pickNextNew(deckId);
  }
  return null;
}

function rate(card: Card, rating: 1|2|3|4, now: Date): Card {
  const cfg = getDeckConfig(card.deckId);
  const prof = cfg.profile;
  const weights = (prof === "INTENSIVE") ? FSRS_WEIGHTS_SUBDAY : FSRS_WEIGHTS_STANDARD;
  const minMinutes = (prof === "INTENSIVE") ? 1 : 1440;
  const k = Math.log(cfg.requestRetention) / Math.log(0.9);

  const isNew = card.state === "new" || !isFinite(card.stability) || !isFinite(card.difficulty);
  const old = snapshot(card);

  let d = isNew ? initDifficulty(rating, weights) : card.difficulty;
  let s = isNew ? initStability(rating, weights)  : card.stability;

  const elapsedDays = isNew ? 0 : Math.max(0, (now.getTime() - new Date(card.lastReviewedAt).getTime()) / 86400000);
  const R = isNew ? 1 : retrievability(elapsedDays, s);

  d = clamp1to10(nextDifficulty(d, rating, weights));
  s = clampPos(nextStability(d, s, R, rating, weights));

  const minutes = Math.max(minMinutes, Math.min(s * k * 1440, 36500*1440));
  const dueAt = new Date(now.getTime() + minutes * 60000).toISOString();

  const updated = {
    ...card,
    state: "review",
    difficulty: d,
    stability: s,
    repetitions: (card.repetitions ?? 0) + 1,
    lapses: (card.lapses ?? 0) + (rating === 1 ? 1 : 0),
    lastReviewedAt: now.toISOString(),
    intervalMinutes: minutes,
    dueAt,
    profileSnapshot: prof
  };

  db.updateCard(updated);
  logReview(old, updated, { rating, elapsedDays, R, cfg, weightsVersion: version(weights) });

  return updated;
}

Concurrency and atomicity
	‚Ä¢	Wrap rate() mutations and review-log insert in a single transaction.
	‚Ä¢	On resume/focus, rebuild the due queue from timestamps; never rely on in-memory session flags.

Performance
	‚Ä¢	Index on (deckId, dueAt) for fast due selection.
	‚Ä¢	Keep a small in-memory buffer of the next N due cards; refresh after every rating.

Testing
	‚Ä¢	Determinism: given fixed time, config, and card state, outputs are stable.
	‚Ä¢	Monotonicity across ratings.
	‚Ä¢	Sub-day resurfacing works in INTENSIVE; not in STANDARD.
	‚Ä¢	No clock-dependent bugs across DST changes (UTC arithmetic only).

This is the scheduler contract and behavior your plugin should implement.

### ‚úÖ TODO 22: Progress bar fix

**IMPLEMENTED**: Unique-first progress tracking with session-based architecture.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- `ReviewSession` interface and database table with fields:
  - `id`, `deckId`, `startedAt`, `endedAt`, `goalTotal`, `doneUnique`
- Session-based progress calculation: `progress = doneUnique / goalTotal`
- Updated `ReviewLog` schema with optional `sessionId` field (no cascade delete)
- Scheduler manages active sessions internally for seamless integration
- Progress only increments on first review of a card per session
- Cards can reappear when due but don't affect progress after first answer

**Implementation Details:**
- **Database Schema v3**: Added `review_sessions` table and `session_id` to `review_logs`
- **Scheduler Enhanced**: 
  - `startReviewSession()`, `getSessionProgress()`, `endReviewSession()`
  - `getOrCreateActiveSession()` for automatic session management
  - Internal session tracking with `setCurrentSession()`
- **FlashcardReviewModal**: Session initialization on mount, real-time progress updates

**Progress Behavior:**
- Goal calculated at session start: due cards + available new cards (respecting daily limits)
- First review of any card increments `doneUnique`
- Subsequent reviews of same card don't affect progress
- Progress bar shows: `(doneUnique / goalTotal) * 100`
- Display format: "Reviewed: X (Y remaining)"

### ‚úÖ Complete CSS Refactoring with Decks Prefix [L1363-1364]
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Branch:** main
**Files Modified:** 6 Svelte components + styles.css
**Description:**
Refactored all CSS classes throughout the project to use a `decks-` prefix for better isolation and to prevent conflicts with other plugins. This ensures that the plugin's styles won't interfere with other Obsidian plugins or themes.

**Key Changes:**
- **All CSS classes prefixed**: Added `decks-` prefix to every CSS class across all components
- **Component isolation**: Each component's styles are properly scoped with prefixed classes
- **Mobile compatibility**: All responsive styles updated with new prefixed classes
- **Global styles**: Main `styles.css` updated with new class names
- **Build verification**: Project builds successfully with no errors after refactoring

**Files Updated:**
- `styles.css` - Main stylesheet with prefixed classes
- `DeckListPanel.svelte` - All CSS classes prefixed (deck-list-panel ‚Üí decks-deck-list-panel)
- `FlashcardReviewModal.svelte` - All CSS classes prefixed (review-modal ‚Üí decks-review-modal)
- `ReviewHeatmap.svelte` - All CSS classes prefixed (heatmap-container ‚Üí decks-heatmap-container)
- `StatisticsUI.svelte` - All CSS classes prefixed (statistics-container ‚Üí decks-statistics-container)
- `DeckConfigUI.svelte` - All CSS classes prefixed (deck-config-ui ‚Üí decks-deck-config-ui)
- `AnkiExportUI.svelte` - All CSS classes prefixed (anki-export-ui ‚Üí decks-anki-export-ui)

**Examples of transformations:**
- `.stats-button` ‚Üí `.decks-stats-button`
- `.difficulty-button` ‚Üí `.decks-difficulty-button`
- `.forecast-chart` ‚Üí `.decks-forecast-chart`
