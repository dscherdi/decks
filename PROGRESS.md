# Obsidian Flashcards Plugin - Progress Tracker

## Project Overview
Building an Obsidian plugin for flashcards with the following key features:
- Side panel showing decks found in vault
- Support for Header+Paragraph and Table flashcard formats
- Deck detection via #flashcards tags
- SQLite database for storing deck and flashcard data
- FSRS algorithm for spaced repetition
- Review modal with 4 difficulty options

## Current Status
âœ… **Implementation Complete** - The plugin has been successfully refactored to meet all core requirements from PROJECT.md. The plugin now provides a fully functional spaced repetition system using the FSRS algorithm, with automatic deck detection from markdown files tagged with #flashcards.

### Recent Bug Fixes
- Fixed sql.js API usage (stmt.all() â†’ stmt.step()/stmt.get() pattern)
- Fixed database path to match plugin ID
- Added directory creation for database storage
- Fixed TypeScript accessibility issues
- Improved error handling and memory management for markdown rendering

  - [ ] Database location configuration
  - [ ] Review session preferences
- [ ] Export/Import functionality for decks
- [ ] Statistics and progress tracking
- [ ] Backup and restore functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database (SQLite via sql.js)
- Created `DatabaseService` class with full CRUD operations
- Schema includes:
  - `decks` table with id, name, tag, last_reviewed
  - `flashcards` table with scheduling data (FSRS fields)
  - `review_logs` table for tracking review history
- Indexes for performance on deck_id, due_date, and review dates

### Deck Management
- `DeckManager` class handles:
  - Scanning vault for #flashcards tags
  - Parsing both Header+Paragraph and Table formats
  - Syncing flashcards with database
  - Auto-generating unique IDs

### FSRS Algorithm
- Implemented FSRS-4.5 with default parameters
- Supports all four difficulty levels
- Calculates intervals based on:
  - Current repetition count
  - Previous ease factor
  - Selected difficulty
  - Retrievability calculation for mature cards

### UI Components (Svelte)
- `DeckListPanel.svelte`: Side panel with deck list
  - Shows deck statistics (new/learning/due)
  - Refresh button for manual sync
  - Clickable rows to start review
- `FlashcardReviewModal.svelte`: Review interface
  - Progress bar and card counter
  - Markdown rendering for card content
  - Difficulty buttons with interval preview
  - Keyboard shortcuts support

### Integration
- Main plugin class coordinates all components
- File watchers for automatic sync on changes
- Review data updates deck last_reviewed timestamp
- Modal wrapper for Obsidian integration

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. ~~Database file location is hardcoded~~ âœ“ Fixed - now uses correct plugin directory
2. No migration strategy for database schema changes
3. Large vaults may experience performance issues during initial sync
4. No conflict resolution for concurrent edits
5. Review logs table grows indefinitely (no cleanup strategy)
6. ~~sql.js API compatibility issues~~ âœ“ Fixed - using correct stmt.step() pattern
7. ~~TypeScript compilation errors~~ âœ“ Fixed - proper property access modifiers


## Summary
