## TODO

1. ‚úÖ Update and Refresh Stats of the deck whenever the user reviews a flashcard
2. ‚úÖ Statistics modal
3. ‚úÖ Add a github style heatmap at the bottom left panel based on the reviews done per day
4. ‚úÖ Filter button on the decks table, to filter decks by name or tag.
5. ‚úÖ Background job that refreshes the side panel stats and data every 5 seconds
6. ‚úÖ Create a configuration page for each deck, which is reached by clicking on a cog icon on the row of the deck list. This configuration page should configure for a particular deck, the number of flashcards to review per session.
7. ‚úÖ Implement Anki-style daily limits for new cards and review cards with proper enforcement
8. ‚úÖ Review order of flashcard should be similar to anki, it should follow this order:
  1. Learning Cards
  	‚Ä¢	Cards currently in a learning or relearning state.
  	‚Ä¢	These always come first to ensure timely repetition within their interval.
  	‚Ä¢	Includes cards you've failed or just learned.
  2. Review Cards (Mature/Due)
  	‚Ä¢	Cards that are due based on spaced repetition.
  	‚Ä¢	Shown after all learning cards.
  	‚Ä¢	Their order is controlled by the deck option "Review order":
  	‚Ä¢	Oldest due first (default)
  	‚Ä¢	Random
  	‚Ä¢	Relative overdueness
  3. New Cards
  	‚Ä¢	Cards never reviewed before.
  	‚Ä¢	Shown after learning and review cards.
  	‚Ä¢	Their order is set by the deck option ‚ÄúNew card order‚Äù:
  	‚Ä¢	Order added (default, based on note ID)
  	‚Ä¢	Random
  	‚Ä¢	Due position
9. ‚úÖ Parse header-paragraph flashcards based on a configurable header level setting. The parser for header-paragraphs should parse only headers with that level and paragraphs it contains.
10. ‚úÖ Add a timelapsed to the review object which tracks how much time it took for the user to review a flashcard from the time it was shown to him until he chooses a difficulty. Use this timelapse in statistics to measure pace of the user seconds/cards.
11. ‚úÖ Mobile support:
  - The modals and views position and size must be adapted for mobile use.
12. ‚úÖ Export deck to anki:
  - A deck can be exported to anki by clicking on the cog icon of the deck, on the deck list.
  - The cog will open a select dropdown where the user can select the option Export to anki.
  - The select dropdown will contain these options:
    - Export to anki
    - Configure deck
  - The export to anki function opens a configuration modal where the user can select options for exporting to anki:
    - The note type
    - Tags the user would like to add to anki
    - Specific anki Deck

  - Each header-paragraph flashcard stores its original header level in database
  - Table flashcards remain unaffected (headerLevel = null)
- **Query Filtering**:
  - Main plugin methods now filter flashcards by current header level setting
  - Filter logic: `(type = 'table' OR header_level = ?)` to include table cards always
  - Stats, review counts, and deck operations respect header level selection
- **User Experience**: Instant header level switching without data loss - all flashcards preserved in database
- **Settings Integration**: Changing header level triggers force sync + view refresh to ensure complete data
- **Test Coverage**: Added unit tests for multi-level parsing and headerLevel property validation

### ‚úÖ Duplicate Flashcard Detection and Warnings
- **Problem**: Users could accidentally create duplicate flashcards with same front text, causing confusion
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive duplicate detection with user notifications using Obsidian's Notice system
- **Detection Points**:
  - During sync: Warns when same front text appears multiple times in a single file
  - Post-sync: Scans entire deck for duplicates across all files and header levels

- **Enhanced ReviewLog Schema**:
  - Extended with essential FSRS fields: `newState`, `newInterval`, `newEaseFactor`, `newRepetitions`, `newLapses`
  - Stores core progression data (intervals, ease factors) and incremental counters (repetitions, lapses)
  - Preserves old/new interval and ease factor for statistics and performance tracking
  - Maintains complete audit trail of learning progression without redundant calculated values
- **Precise Due Date Calculation**:
  - Formula: `dueDate = reviewedAt + (newInterval * 60 * 1000)` for mathematical precision
  - No timing drift or approximation errors - exact FSRS scheduling preserved
  - Perfect restoration of review timing regardless of when flashcard is recreated
- **Direct Stability Storage**:
  - Added `newStability` field to ReviewLog interface and database schema
  - Stability stored directly when calculated during actual review process
  - No complex recalculation needed - uses exact FSRS-computed stability values
  - Eliminates approximation errors and ensures perfect stability restoration
- **Database Implementation**:
  - Added `getLatestReviewLogForFlashcard()` method with optimized query: ORDER BY reviewed_at DESC LIMIT 1
  - Extended review_logs table with `new_stability` column for direct storage
