# Obsidian Flashcards Plugin - Progress Summary

## âœ… Core Features Implemented
- SQLite database with sql.js for persistence
- FSRS-4.5 spaced repetition algorithm
- Deck management with file-based naming
- Header-paragraph and table flashcard parsing
- Review interface with difficulty ratings
- Real-time statistics and progress tracking
- Settings page with customizable parameters

## âœ… Database Schema
- `decks` table: id, name, tag, timestamps
- `flashcards` table: content, FSRS data, state, contentHash
- `review_logs` table: review history tracking
- Foreign key constraints and performance indexes

## âœ… Smart Sync System
- Content hash-based change detection (back content only)
- ID-based flashcard identification (front content hash)
- Learning progress preservation during file updates
- Unified sync logic for tag-based and name-based operations
- Selective updates: only changed content gets modified
- Automatic cleanup of removed flashcards

## âœ… FSRS Implementation
- Full FSRS-4.5 algorithm with optimized parameters
- Scientific memory modeling with stability/difficulty
- Dynamic interval calculation based on performance
- State transitions: new â†’ learning â†’ review
- Comprehensive review logging for analytics

## âœ… UI Components (Svelte)
- Deck list panel with real-time stats
- Flashcard review modal with smooth animations
- Settings interface with validation
- Progress indicators and completion feedback

## âœ… Key Enhancements
- File-based deck naming instead of tag parsing
- CSS injection system for proper styling
- Memory management and error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage (32 tests)
- TypeScript implementation with strict typing

## âœ… User Experience
- No learning progress lost during file edits
- Seamless content updates with change detection
- Real-time statistics updates during reviews
- Simplified settings with sensible defaults
- Consistent behavior across all sync methods

## âœ… Frontmatter Deck ID Integration
- Deck IDs automatically stored in markdown file frontmatter
- `flashcards-deck-id` field links files to database decks
- Preserves deck relationships when files are moved/renamed
- Existing frontmatter content preserved during updates
- Smart sync prioritizes frontmatter IDs over tag-based lookup

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture
- **Database**: SQLite via sql.js with automatic persistence
- **Algorithm**: FSRS-4.5 with scientific parameter optimization
- **Sync**: Smart content-based diffing preserves learning data
- **UI**: Svelte components with reactive state management
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive mocking and coverage

## ðŸ“¦ Files Structure
- `src/main.ts` - Plugin entry point and core logic
- `src/database/` - DatabaseService and type definitions
- `src/services/` - DeckManager with smart sync logic
- `src/algorithm/` - FSRS implementation
- `src/components/` - Svelte UI components
- `src/__tests__/` - Comprehensive test suite

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
- **Fully functional** spaced repetition system
- **Production ready** with comprehensive testing
- **Learning progress preserved** across all operations
- **Optimized performance** with efficient algorithms
- **User-friendly** with intuitive interface and behavior
- **Persistent deck relationships** via frontmatter integration


## TODO

1. âœ… Update and Refresh Stats of the deck whenever the user reviews a flashcard
2. Create statistics page for each deck which shows retention percentage as graph,
3. âœ… Add a github style heatmap at the bottom left panel based on the reviews done per day
4. âœ… Filter button on the decks table, to filter decks by name or tag.
5. âœ… Background job that refreshes the side panel stats and data every 5 seconds

## âœ… Recent Enhancements

### Real-time Stats Updates
- Added efficient deck-specific stats refresh after each flashcard review
- Created `refreshDeckStats(deckId)` method for targeted updates
- Modified review flow to trigger stats refresh automatically
- Optimized performance by updating only the reviewed deck instead of all decks
- Maintained existing general refresh functionality for other operations

### Background Stats Refresh
- Implemented configurable background job to refresh deck stats automatically
- Default 5-second interval with user-configurable setting (1-60 seconds)
- **Invisible updates** - only changes stats numbers, no UI rebuilding
- **Change detection** - only updates stats that actually changed
- Added UI settings section with background refresh interval control
- Automatic restart of background job when settings change
- Proper cleanup on view close to prevent memory leaks
- Optimized performance with stats caching and minimal DOM updates

### Deck Filter Functionality
- Added real-time filter input field in deck list panel
- Case-insensitive search across both deck name and tag fields
- Reactive filtering that updates as user types
- Dual state management: preserves original deck list while showing filtered results
- Smart empty state handling for both no decks and no filtered results
- Integrated with existing deck refresh and stats update systems
- Clean UI following Obsidian design patterns

### GitHub-Style Review Heatmap
- Added interactive heatmap component showing review activity over past year
- GitHub-style design with 5 intensity levels based on daily review counts
- Positioned at bottom of deck list panel for easy visibility
- Real-time updates when reviews are completed
- Tooltips showing exact review counts and dates
- Responsive month and day labels for easy navigation
- Optimized performance with efficient date range queries
- Theme-aware styling for both light and dark modes
- Background refresh integration for automatic data updates
- Responsive design that adjusts weeks shown based on container width

### Unique Flashcard ID Generation
- Enhanced flashcard ID generation to include deck ID for vault-wide uniqueness
- Changed from `generateFlashcardId(frontText)` to `generateFlashcardId(frontText, deckId)`
- IDs now combine deck ID and front content: `${deckId}:${frontText}` for hashing
- Prevents ID collisions when same question appears in different decks
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing learning progress
- Updated comprehensive test coverage for new ID generation logic
- Ensures data integrity across all deck operations and file movements
