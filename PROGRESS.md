## Flashcard State Logic Fix

### Problem Identified
Cards were getting stuck in the "New" state and not transitioning properly between New â†’ Learning â†’ Review states.

### Root Cause Analysis
The original state logic had flaws in how it categorized flashcards:
- **New cards**: Only checked `repetitions = 0` without considering due date
- **Learning cards**: Only checked interval and repetitions, ignoring due date
- **Due cards**: Correctly checked due date but had wrong interval logic

This meant that new cards with `dueDate = now` weren't showing up as reviewable, and the state transitions weren't working correctly.

### Solution Implemented
Fixed the database statistics logic in `DatabaseService.getDeckStats()`:

**Before:**
```sql
-- New cards (problematic)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND repetitions = 0

-- Learning cards (missing due date check)  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND repetitions > 0 AND interval < 1440

-- Due cards (wrong column order)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND due_date <= ? AND interval >= 1440
```

**After:**
```sql
-- New cards (now includes due date check)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND repetitions = 0 AND due_date <= ?

-- Learning cards (now includes due date check)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND repetitions > 0 AND interval < 1440 AND due_date <= ?

-- Review cards (cleaner logic)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND interval >= 1440 AND due_date <= ?
```

### New Features Added
- **`getReviewableFlashcards()` method**: Returns cards due for review in optimal order (New â†’ Learning â†’ Review)
- **Proper review flow**: Review modal now uses reviewable cards instead of all cards
- **State-aware UI**: Deck statistics now correctly reflect card states

### State Definitions (Corrected)
- **New**: `repetitions = 0` AND `due_date <= now` (never reviewed, ready for first review)
- **Learning**: `repetitions > 0` AND `interval < 1440` AND `due_date <= now` (short intervals, due for review)
- **Review**: `interval >= 1440` AND `due_date <= now` (mature cards, due for review)

### Files Modified
- âœ… `src/database/DatabaseService.ts` - Fixed state logic and added getReviewableFlashcards()
- âœ… `src/main.ts` - Updated review flow to use reviewable cards
- âœ… `src/__tests__/DatabaseService.test.ts` - Updated tests for corrected logic

### Result
Flashcards now properly transition between states:
1. **New** cards appear in "New" count and are available for first review
2. After review, cards move to **Learning** state with short intervals
3. Eventually graduate to **Review** state with longer intervals
4. Cards only show in counts when they're actually due for review

The fix resolves the core issue where cards were stuck in the "New" state!

## Real-Time Stats Updates

### Enhancement Implemented
Added real-time statistics updates in the deck list panel that refresh after every flashcard review, providing immediate feedback on progress.

### Features Added
- **Live Stats Refresh**: Deck statistics (New/Learning/Due counts) update immediately after each card review
- **Visual Feedback**: Brief opacity animation indicates when stats are updating
- **Performance Optimization**: Throttled updates (300ms) prevent excessive refreshes during rapid reviews
- **Callback System**: Clean separation of concerns with onCardReviewed callbacks

### Technical Implementation
- **`refreshStats()` method**: Fast stats-only refresh without full deck resync
- **Throttling mechanism**: Prevents UI lag during rapid card reviews
- **Visual indicators**: Temporary opacity changes show update status
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and event handlers

### User Experience Improvements
- **Immediate feedback**: Users see card count changes right after reviewing
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time visibility of session progress
- **Responsive UI**: Smooth updates without blocking interface
- **Visual polish**: Subtle animations provide professional feel

### Files Modified
- âœ… `src/main.ts` - Added refreshStats() with throttling, onCardReviewed callback
- âœ… `src/components/FlashcardReviewModal.svelte` - Added onCardReviewed prop and calls
- âœ… `src/components/DeckListPanel.svelte` - Added visual feedback for stats updates

### Result
The deck list now provides real-time feedback during review sessions, making progress immediately visible and improving the overall user experience!

## Settings Simplification

### Enhancement Implemented
Simplified the settings interface by removing unnecessary options and adopting sensible defaults for better user experience.

### Settings Removed
- **Auto Show Answer**: Removed automatic answer reveal functionality
- **Answer Delay**: No longer needed without auto-show
- **Deck Name from Tag**: Always extract meaningful names from tags (e.g., #flashcards/math â†’ "math") 
- **Show Card Counts**: Always display New/Learning/Due counts in deck list
- **Color Code Counts**: Always apply blue highlighting to card counts > 0

### Remaining Settings
The streamlined settings now focus on core customization:

**FSRS Algorithm**
- Target retention rate (0.7-0.98)
- Maximum interval (days)
- Easy bonus multiplier 
- Hard interval multiplier
- Reset to defaults option

**Database**
- Custom database path
- Auto backup toggle
- Backup interval (days)

**Review Sessions**
- Show progress bar toggle
- Keyboard shortcuts toggle (1-4 keys)
- Session limit toggle
- Session goal (cards per session)

### Benefits
- **Cleaner Interface**: Fewer toggles reduce cognitive load
- **Better Defaults**: Core features always enabled for optimal experience
- **Simpler Logic**: Removed conditional rendering complexity
- **Consistent Behavior**: No surprises with missing UI elements
- **Faster Setup**: New users get full functionality immediately

### Files Modified
- âœ… `src/settings.ts` - Removed display and auto-answer settings
- âœ… `src/components/SettingsTab.ts` - Simplified settings UI
- âœ… `src/components/FlashcardReviewModal.svelte` - Removed auto-show logic, always show shortcuts
- âœ… `src/components/DeckListPanel.svelte` - Always show counts and color coding, removed settings prop

### Result
The plugin now has a cleaner, more focused settings interface while maintaining all essential functionality with sensible defaults!

## CSS Injection Fix

### Problem Identified
Svelte component styles were not being properly bundled by esbuild, causing the DeckListPanel layout to appear broken with missing columns and incorrect formatting.

### Root Cause
The esbuild-svelte plugin was configured to extract CSS to external files (`css: "external"`), but Obsidian plugins don't automatically load separate CSS files, causing component styles to be missing.

### Solution Implemented
Fixed the esbuild configuration to inject CSS directly into the JavaScript bundle instead of extracting it to separate files.

### Changes Made
- **Updated esbuild config**: Changed `css: "external"` to `css: "injected"` in svelte plugin options
- **Component-scoped styles**: Each Svelte component keeps its own `<style>` block
- **Automatic CSS injection**: Styles are injected when components are loaded
- **No global pollution**: Maintained component-scoped styling architecture

### Technical Configuration
```javascript
sveltePlugin({
  compilerOptions: {
    dev: !prod,
    css: "injected", // Changed from "external"
  },
})
```

### Benefits
- âœ… **Component Isolation**: Each component maintains its own styles
- âœ… **Automatic Loading**: CSS injects when component mounts
- âœ… **No External Dependencies**: No separate CSS files to manage
- âœ… **Obsidian Compatibility**: Works with plugin loading mechanism
- âœ… **Maintainable Architecture**: Styles stay with their components

### Files Modified
- âœ… `esbuild.config.mjs` - Fixed CSS injection configuration
- âœ… `src/components/DeckListPanel.svelte` - Restored component styles
- âœ… `src/main.ts` - Removed temporary global CSS injection

### Result
The DeckListPanel now displays correctly with proper component-scoped CSS injection, maintaining clean architecture while ensuring reliable styling!

## File-Based Deck Naming Fix

### Problem Identified
Deck names were being derived from tags (e.g., #flashcards/math â†’ "Math") instead of using the actual markdown file names, making it difficult to identify which file a deck represents.

### Root Cause
The `extractDeckName()` method was parsing tag strings to generate deck names, but users expect deck names to match their file names for easier identification.

### Solution Implemented
Changed deck naming logic to use markdown file names instead of tag-derived names.

### Changes Made
- **Updated `DeckManager.syncDecks()`**: Now calls `extractDeckNameFromFiles()` instead of `extractDeckName()`
- **New method `extractDeckNameFromFiles()`**: Uses the first file's basename as the deck name
- **Updated `DeckListPanel.formatDeckName()`**: Now returns `deck.name` directly instead of formatting from tag
- **Updated tests**: Modified expectations to match file-based naming

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Before: Tag-based naming
private extractDeckName(tag: string): string {
  let name = tag.replace("#flashcards", "");
  // ... tag parsing logic
}

// After: File-based naming  
private extractDeckNameFromFiles(files: TFile[]): string {
  if (files.length === 0) return "General";
  return files[0].basename;
}
```

### Behavior Changes
- **Before**: #flashcards/math/algebra â†’ "Math - Algebra"
- **After**: algebra-formulas.md â†’ "algebra-formulas"

### Edge Cases Handled
- **Multiple files per tag**: Uses the first file's name
- **Empty files array**: Falls back to "General"
- **File extensions**: Automatically removed (uses `basename`)

### Benefits
- âœ… **Clear Identification**: Deck names match file names exactly
- âœ… **User Intuitive**: No need to guess which file contains which deck
- âœ… **Consistent Naming**: What you see in file explorer matches deck list
- âœ… **Simpler Logic**: No complex tag parsing required

### Files Modified
- âœ… `src/services/DeckManager.ts` - Added extractDeckNameFromFiles() method
- âœ… `src/components/DeckListPanel.svelte` - Simplified formatDeckName() function
- âœ… `src/__tests__/DeckManager.test.ts` - Updated tests for file-based naming

### Result
Deck names now clearly show which markdown file they represent, making it much easier for users to identify and manage their flashcard decks!

## Icon Update

### Enhancement Implemented
Updated the flashcards plugin icon from the generic "cards" icon to the more appropriate "brain" icon to better represent learning and memory.

### Changes Made
- **Ribbon Icon**: Changed from "cards" to "brain" for the plugin ribbon button
- **Side Panel Icon**: Updated the view icon to "brain" for consistency
- **Visual Identity**: Better represents the learning/memory aspect of flashcards

### Benefits
- âœ… **Better Representation**: Brain icon clearly indicates learning and memory functionality
- âœ… **Improved Recognition**: More intuitive icon for users to identify the flashcards plugin
- âœ… **Consistent Branding**: Same icon used in both ribbon and side panel
- âœ… **Professional Appearance**: Modern, appropriate icon for educational tools

### Files Modified
- âœ… `src/main.ts` - Updated both ribbon and view icons to "brain"

### Result
The plugin now has a more appropriate and recognizable icon that clearly represents its learning and memory functionality!

## Full FSRS Algorithm Implementation

### Major Enhancement Implemented
Replaced the hybrid FSRS implementation with a complete FSRS-4.5 algorithm for optimal spaced repetition scheduling based on scientific research.

### Previous Implementation Issues
- **Hybrid approach**: Mixed FSRS concepts with hardcoded intervals
- **Simplified learning phase**: Used basic multipliers (1min, 5min, 10min) instead of FSRS calculations
- **Incomplete state tracking**: Missing FSRS-specific data like stability and difficulty
- **Suboptimal scheduling**: Not leveraging full FSRS research benefits

### Full FSRS-4.5 Implementation

#### Core FSRS Components Added
```typescript
export interface FSRSCard {
  stability: number;        // Memory stability
  difficulty: number;       // Card difficulty (1-10)
  elapsedDays: number;     // Days since last review
  scheduledDays: number;   // Scheduled interval in days
  reps: number;            // Total repetitions
  lapses: number;          // Number of failures
  state: FSRSState;        // FSRS state machine
  lastReview: Date;        // Last review timestamp
}
```

#### FSRS Algorithm Functions
- **`initStability()`**: Calculate initial memory stability based on rating
- **`initDifficulty()`**: Set initial difficulty using FSRS formula
- **`forgettingCurve()`**: Model memory decay over time
- **`nextStability()`**: Update stability based on performance and retrievability
- **`nextDifficulty()`**: Adjust difficulty with mean reversion
- **`nextInterval()`**: Calculate optimal review interval from stability

#### Enhanced Data Model
```sql
-- Added FSRS-specific fields to database
stability REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 2.5,
lapses INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
last_reviewed TEXT,
```

#### FSRS State Machine
- **New â†’ Learning/Review**: Based on initial performance
- **Learning â†” Review**: Dynamic transitions based on intervals
- **Relearning**: Special state for forgotten cards
- **Automatic state management**: No manual state tracking needed

### Key FSRS Features Implemented

#### 1. Scientific Memory Modeling
```typescript
// Forgetting curve calculation
private forgettingCurve(elapsedDays: number, stability: number): number {
  return Math.pow(1 + elapsedDays / (9 * stability), -1);
}
```

#### 2. Adaptive Difficulty
```typescript
// Difficulty adjustment with mean reversion
private nextDifficulty(difficulty: number, rating: number): number {
  const nextD = difficulty - this.params.w[6] * (rating - 3);
  return Math.min(Math.max(this.meanReversion(this.params.w[4], nextD), 1), 10);
}
```

#### 3. Dynamic Stability Updates
```typescript
// Stability calculation based on retrievability and performance
private nextStability(difficulty: number, stability: number, retrievability: number, rating: number): number {
  const hardPenalty = rating === 2 ? this.params.w[15] : 1;
  const easyBonus = rating === 4 ? this.params.w[16] : 1;
  return stability * (1 + Math.exp(this.params.w[8]) * (11 - difficulty) * /* ... complex formula ... */);
}
```

#### 4. Optimal Interval Calculation
```typescript
// Calculate next review interval from stability
private nextInterval(stability: number): number {
  const interval = stability * (Math.log(this.params.requestRetention) / Math.log(0.9));
  return Math.min(Math.max(Math.round(interval), 1), this.params.maximumInterval);
}
```

### FSRS Parameters (Optimized)
```typescript
w: [
  0.4072, 1.1829, 3.1262, 15.4722, 7.2102, 0.5316, 1.0651, 0.0234, 
  1.616, 0.1544, 1.0824, 1.9813, 0.0953, 0.2975, 2.2042, 0.2407, 2.9466
],
requestRetention: 0.9,    // 90% target retention
maximumInterval: 36500,   // 100 years maximum
```

- âœ… `src/database/DatabaseService.ts` - Updated schema and queries for FSRS data
- âœ… `src/services/DeckManager.ts` - Initialize FSRS fields for new cards
- âœ… `src/__tests__/DatabaseService.test.ts` - Updated tests for FSRS fields

### Technical Implementation Highlights

#### State Management
```typescript
// Automatic state transitions based on FSRS logic
if (card.state === "New") {
  newCard.stability = this.initStability(rating);
  newCard.difficulty = this.initDifficulty(rating);
  newCard.state = rating === 1 ? "Learning" : "Review";
}
```

#### Interval Calculation
```typescript
// FSRS interval calculation (days converted to minutes)
const interval = this.nextInterval(newCard.stability);
return {
  interval: Math.round(interval * 1440), // Convert days to minutes
  stability: newCard.stability,
  difficulty: newCard.difficulty,
};
```

### Result
The plugin now uses the complete, scientifically-optimized FSRS-4.5 algorithm, providing users with the most effective spaced repetition scheduling available, leading to better long-term retention with fewer reviews!

## Deck Sync Bug Fix

### Problem Identified
Users were encountering "UNIQUE constraint failed: decks.tag" errors when refreshing flashcards, causing the sync process to fail and preventing proper deck management.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Race condition**: Multiple sync operations could attempt to create the same deck simultaneously
- **Duplicate creation attempts**: The sync logic wasn't properly handling existing decks
- **Missing error handling**: Database constraint failures weren't gracefully handled
- **Memory leaks**: SQL statements weren't being properly freed after execution

### Solution Implemented
Implemented robust deck synchronization with proper upsert logic and comprehensive error handling.

#### 1. Improved Deck Creation Logic
```typescript
// Before: Simple INSERT (could fail on duplicates)
INSERT INTO decks (id, name, tag, ...) VALUES (...)

// After: Robust upsert with existence check
const existingDeck = await this.getDeckByTag(deck.tag);
if (existingDeck) {
  // Update name if file was renamed
  if (existingDeck.name !== deck.name) {
    UPDATE decks SET name = ?, modified = ? WHERE tag = ?
  }
  return existingDeck;
}
// Only create if truly new
INSERT INTO decks (...)
```

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
```typescript
// Added try-catch around individual deck creation
for (const [tag, files] of decksMap) {
  if (!existingTags.has(tag)) {
    try {
      await this.db.createDeck(deck);
      newDecksCreated++;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to create deck for tag ${tag}:`, error);
      // Continue with other decks instead of failing completely
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Memory Management Improvements
Added proper SQL statement cleanup to prevent memory leaks:
```typescript
// Fixed all database operations to include cleanup
stmt.run([...]);
stmt.free(); // Prevents memory leaks
await this.save();
```

#### 4. Comprehensive Logging
Added detailed logging for better debugging and monitoring:
```typescript
console.log("Starting deck sync...");
console.log(`Found ${decksMap.size} deck tags in vault, ${existingDecks.length} existing decks`);
console.log(`Creating new deck: "${deckName}" with tag: ${tag}`);
console.log(`Deck sync completed. Created ${newDecksCreated} new decks.`);
```

### Benefits Achieved
- âœ… **No More Constraint Errors**: Proper upsert logic prevents duplicate deck creation
- âœ… **Graceful Error Handling**: Individual deck failures don't break entire sync
- âœ… **Memory Efficiency**: Proper statement cleanup prevents memory leaks
- âœ… **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify issues

## Flashcard INSERT Statement Bug Fix

### Problem Identified
Users were encountering "16 values for 17 columns" errors when starting review sessions, preventing flashcard creation and review functionality from working properly.

### Root Cause Analysis
The SQL INSERT statement for creating flashcards had a mismatch between the number of columns specified and the number of parameter placeholders:
- **Database schema**: 17 columns (including new FSRS fields: stability, lapses, last_reviewed)
- **INSERT statement**: Only 16 `?` placeholders in VALUES clause
- **Data values**: 17 values being passed to the statement

### Error Details
```
Error: 16 values for 17 columns
at DatabaseService.createFlashcard
at DeckManager.syncFlashcardsForDeck
at FlashcardsView.startReview
```

### Solution Implemented
Fixed the INSERT statement to include the correct number of parameter placeholders matching the column count.

#### Before (Broken)
```sql
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO flashcards (
  id, deck_id, front, back, type, source_file, line_number,
  state, due_date, interval, repetitions, ease_factor, stability, lapses, last_reviewed, created, modified
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
--        ^-- Only 16 placeholders for 17 columns
```

#### After (Fixed)
```sql
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO flashcards (
  id, deck_id, front, back, type, source_file, line_number,
  state, due_date, interval, repetitions, ease_factor, stability, lapses, last_reviewed, created, modified
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
--        ^-- Correct 17 placeholders for 17 columns
```

### Database Schema Verification
Confirmed all 17 columns are properly aligned:
1. id, 2. deck_id, 3. front, 4. back, 5. type, 6. source_file, 7. line_number
8. state, 9. due_date, 10. interval, 11. repetitions, 12. ease_factor
13. stability, 14. lapses, 15. last_reviewed, 16. created, 17. modified

### Benefits Achieved
- âœ… **Review Sessions Work**: Users can now start review sessions without errors
- âœ… **Flashcard Creation**: New flashcards are properly created with all FSRS data
- âœ… **Data Integrity**: All database fields are correctly populated
- âœ… **FSRS Functionality**: Full algorithm works with proper data storage

### Files Modified
- âœ… `src/database/DatabaseService.ts` - Fixed INSERT statement placeholder count

### Result
Flashcard creation and review functionality now works correctly with the full FSRS implementation, allowing users to study their flashcards without database errors!

## Flashcard State Model Improvements

### Problem Identified
The original flashcard data model was missing explicit state tracking, relying on derived calculations from repetitions and intervals to determine card states (New/Learning/Review). This led to inconsistent state logic and potential edge cases.

### Root Cause
- No explicit `state` field in the flashcard data model
- State determination based on complex calculations across multiple fields
- Inconsistent logic between statistics calculation and card ordering
- Difficult to maintain and debug state transitions

### Solution Implemented
Added explicit state tracking to the flashcard data model and updated all related logic to use state-based operations.

### Data Model Changes
```typescript
// Before: Implicit state calculation
export interface Flashcard {
  // ... other fields
  dueDate: string;
  interval: number;
  repetitions: number;
  easeFactor: number;
}

// After: Explicit state tracking
export type FlashcardState = "new" | "learning" | "review";

export interface Flashcard {
  // ... other fields
  state: FlashcardState;
  dueDate: string;
  interval: number;
  repetitions: number;
  easeFactor: number;
}
```

### Database Schema Updates
- **Added `state` column**: TEXT field with CHECK constraint for valid states
- **Updated CREATE/UPDATE queries**: Include state field in all operations
- **Modified statistics queries**: Use state-based filtering instead of complex calculations

### State Logic Improvements
```sql
-- Before: Complex derived state calculations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards 
WHERE deck_id = ? AND repetitions = 0 AND due_date <= ?

-- After: Simple state-based queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards 
WHERE deck_id = ? AND state = 'new' AND due_date <= ?
```

### State Transition Rules
- **New â†’ Learning**: After first review with any difficulty
- **Learning â†’ Review**: When interval reaches 1 day (1440 minutes)
- **Review â†’ Learning**: When "Again" is selected (back to learning)
- **Any â†’ New**: Only when repetitions reset to 0

### FSRS Algorithm Integration
Updated the FSRS algorithm to automatically set the correct state based on the calculated interval:
```typescript
let newState: "new" | "learning" | "review";
if (schedule.repetitions === 0) {
  newState = "new";
} else if (schedule.interval < 1440) {
  newState = "learning";
} else {
  newState = "review";
}
```

### Benefits
- âœ… **Explicit State Management**: Clear, unambiguous state tracking
- âœ… **Simplified Logic**: No complex derivations needed
- âœ… **Better Performance**: Direct state queries instead of calculations
- âœ… **Easier Debugging**: State transitions are explicit and traceable
- âœ… **Consistent Behavior**: Same state logic used everywhere
- âœ… **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new states or modify logic

### Files Modified
- âœ… `src/database/types.ts` - Added FlashcardState type and state field
- âœ… `src/database/DatabaseService.ts` - Updated schema and queries for state-based operations
- âœ… `src/services/DeckManager.ts` - Set initial state for new flashcards
- âœ… `src/algorithm/fsrs.ts` - Added automatic state transitions based on intervals
- âœ… `src/__tests__/DatabaseService.test.ts` - Updated tests for state-based logic

### Migration Impact
- **New installations**: Use state-based model from the start
- **Existing data**: Database schema includes DEFAULT 'new' for backward compatibility
- **Automatic migration**: Existing cards will be assigned appropriate states on first review

### Result
The flashcard state system is now explicit, consistent, and maintainable, providing a solid foundation for accurate card statistics and reliable state transitions!
