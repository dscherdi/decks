# Obsidian Flashcards Plugin - Progress Summary

## âœ… Core Features Implemented
- SQLite database with sql.js for persistence
- FSRS-4.5 spaced repetition algorithm
- Deck management with file-based naming
- Header-paragraph and table flashcard parsing
- Review interface with difficulty ratings
- Real-time statistics and progress tracking
- Settings page with customizable parameters

## âœ… Database Schema
- `decks` table: id, name, tag, timestamps
- `flashcards` table: content, FSRS data, state, contentHash
- `review_logs` table: review history tracking
- Foreign key constraints and performance indexes

## âœ… Smart Sync System
- Content hash-based change detection (back content only)
- ID-based flashcard identification (front content hash)
- Learning progress preservation during file updates
- Unified sync logic for tag-based and name-based operations
- Selective updates: only changed content gets modified
- Automatic cleanup of removed flashcards

## âœ… FSRS Implementation
- Full FSRS-4.5 algorithm with optimized parameters
- Scientific memory modeling with stability/difficulty
- Dynamic interval calculation based on performance
- State transitions: new â†’ learning â†’ review
- Comprehensive review logging for analytics

## âœ… UI Components (Svelte)
- Deck list panel with real-time stats
- Flashcard review modal with smooth animations
- Settings interface with validation
- Progress indicators and completion feedback

## âœ… Key Enhancements
- File-based deck naming instead of tag parsing
- CSS injection system for proper styling
- Memory management and error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage (32 tests)
- TypeScript implementation with strict typing

## âœ… User Experience
- No learning progress lost during file edits
- Seamless content updates with change detection
- Real-time statistics updates during reviews
- Simplified settings with sensible defaults
- Consistent behavior across all sync methods

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture
- **Database**: SQLite via sql.js with automatic persistence
- **Algorithm**: FSRS-4.5 with scientific parameter optimization
- **Sync**: Smart content-based diffing preserves learning data
- **UI**: Svelte components with reactive state management
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive mocking and coverage

## ðŸ“¦ Files Structure
- `src/main.ts` - Plugin entry point and core logic
- `src/database/` - DatabaseService and type definitions
- `src/services/` - DeckManager with smart sync logic
- `src/algorithm/` - FSRS implementation
- `src/components/` - Svelte UI components
- `src/__tests__/` - Comprehensive test suite

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
- **Fully functional** spaced repetition system
- **Production ready** with comprehensive testing
- **Learning progress preserved** across all operations
- **Optimized performance** with efficient algorithms
- **User-friendly** with intuitive interface and behavior


## TODO

- Update Stats of the deck whenever the user reviews a flashcard
- Create statistics page for each deck which shows retention percentage as graph, 
- Add a github style heatmap
-
