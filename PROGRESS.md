## Flashcard State Logic Fix

### Problem Identified
Cards were getting stuck in the "New" state and not transitioning properly between New â†’ Learning â†’ Review states.

### Root Cause Analysis
The original state logic had flaws in how it categorized flashcards:
- **New cards**: Only checked `repetitions = 0` without considering due date
- **Learning cards**: Only checked interval and repetitions, ignoring due date
- **Due cards**: Correctly checked due date but had wrong interval logic

This meant that new cards with `dueDate = now` weren't showing up as reviewable, and the state transitions weren't working correctly.

### Solution Implemented
Fixed the database statistics logic in `DatabaseService.getDeckStats()`:

**Before:**
```sql
-- New cards (problematic)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND repetitions = 0

-- Learning cards (missing due date check)  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND repetitions > 0 AND interval < 1440

-- Due cards (wrong column order)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND due_date <= ? AND interval >= 1440
```

**After:**
```sql
-- New cards (now includes due date check)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND repetitions = 0 AND due_date <= ?

-- Learning cards (now includes due date check)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND repetitions > 0 AND interval < 1440 AND due_date <= ?

-- Review cards (cleaner logic)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flashcards WHERE deck_id = ? AND interval >= 1440 AND due_date <= ?
```

### New Features Added
- **`getReviewableFlashcards()` method**: Returns cards due for review in optimal order (New â†’ Learning â†’ Review)
- **Proper review flow**: Review modal now uses reviewable cards instead of all cards
- **State-aware UI**: Deck statistics now correctly reflect card states

### State Definitions (Corrected)
- **New**: `repetitions = 0` AND `due_date <= now` (never reviewed, ready for first review)
- **Learning**: `repetitions > 0` AND `interval < 1440` AND `due_date <= now` (short intervals, due for review)
- **Review**: `interval >= 1440` AND `due_date <= now` (mature cards, due for review)

### Files Modified
- âœ… `src/database/DatabaseService.ts` - Fixed state logic and added getReviewableFlashcards()
- âœ… `src/main.ts` - Updated review flow to use reviewable cards
- âœ… `src/__tests__/DatabaseService.test.ts` - Updated tests for corrected logic

### Result
Flashcards now properly transition between states:
1. **New** cards appear in "New" count and are available for first review
2. After review, cards move to **Learning** state with short intervals
3. Eventually graduate to **Review** state with longer intervals
4. Cards only show in counts when they're actually due for review

The fix resolves the core issue where cards were stuck in the "New" state!

## Real-Time Stats Updates

### Enhancement Implemented
Added real-time statistics updates in the deck list panel that refresh after every flashcard review, providing immediate feedback on progress.

### Features Added
- **Live Stats Refresh**: Deck statistics (New/Learning/Due counts) update immediately after each card review
- **Visual Feedback**: Brief opacity animation indicates when stats are updating
- **Performance Optimization**: Throttled updates (300ms) prevent excessive refreshes during rapid reviews
- **Callback System**: Clean separation of concerns with onCardReviewed callbacks

### Technical Implementation
- **`refreshStats()` method**: Fast stats-only refresh without full deck resync
- **Throttling mechanism**: Prevents UI lag during rapid card reviews
- **Visual indicators**: Temporary opacity changes show update status
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and event handlers

### User Experience Improvements
- **Immediate feedback**: Users see card count changes right after reviewing
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time visibility of session progress
- **Responsive UI**: Smooth updates without blocking interface
- **Visual polish**: Subtle animations provide professional feel

### Files Modified
- âœ… `src/main.ts` - Added refreshStats() with throttling, onCardReviewed callback
- âœ… `src/components/FlashcardReviewModal.svelte` - Added onCardReviewed prop and calls
- âœ… `src/components/DeckListPanel.svelte` - Added visual feedback for stats updates

### Result
The deck list now provides real-time feedback during review sessions, making progress immediately visible and improving the overall user experience!

## Settings Simplification

### Enhancement Implemented
Simplified the settings interface by removing unnecessary options and adopting sensible defaults for better user experience.

### Settings Removed
- **Auto Show Answer**: Removed automatic answer reveal functionality
- **Answer Delay**: No longer needed without auto-show
- **Deck Name from Tag**: Always extract meaningful names from tags (e.g., #flashcards/math â†’ "math") 
- **Show Card Counts**: Always display New/Learning/Due counts in deck list
- **Color Code Counts**: Always apply blue highlighting to card counts > 0

### Remaining Settings
The streamlined settings now focus on core customization:

**FSRS Algorithm**
- Target retention rate (0.7-0.98)
- Maximum interval (days)
- Easy bonus multiplier 
- Hard interval multiplier
- Reset to defaults option

**Database**
- Custom database path
- Auto backup toggle
- Backup interval (days)

**Review Sessions**
- Show progress bar toggle
- Keyboard shortcuts toggle (1-4 keys)
- Session limit toggle
- Session goal (cards per session)

### Benefits
- **Cleaner Interface**: Fewer toggles reduce cognitive load
- **Better Defaults**: Core features always enabled for optimal experience
- **Simpler Logic**: Removed conditional rendering complexity
- **Consistent Behavior**: No surprises with missing UI elements
- **Faster Setup**: New users get full functionality immediately

### Files Modified
- âœ… `src/settings.ts` - Removed display and auto-answer settings
- âœ… `src/components/SettingsTab.ts` - Simplified settings UI
- âœ… `src/components/FlashcardReviewModal.svelte` - Removed auto-show logic, always show shortcuts
- âœ… `src/components/DeckListPanel.svelte` - Always show counts and color coding, removed settings prop

### Result
The plugin now has a cleaner, more focused settings interface while maintaining all essential functionality with sensible defaults!

## CSS Injection Fix

### Problem Identified
Svelte component styles were not being properly bundled by esbuild, causing the DeckListPanel layout to appear broken with missing columns and incorrect formatting.

### Root Cause
The esbuild-svelte plugin was configured to extract CSS to external files (`css: "external"`), but Obsidian plugins don't automatically load separate CSS files, causing component styles to be missing.

### Solution Implemented
Fixed the esbuild configuration to inject CSS directly into the JavaScript bundle instead of extracting it to separate files.

### Changes Made
- **Updated esbuild config**: Changed `css: "external"` to `css: "injected"` in svelte plugin options
- **Component-scoped styles**: Each Svelte component keeps its own `<style>` block
- **Automatic CSS injection**: Styles are injected when components are loaded
- **No global pollution**: Maintained component-scoped styling architecture

### Technical Configuration
```javascript
sveltePlugin({
  compilerOptions: {
    dev: !prod,
    css: "injected", // Changed from "external"
  },
})
```

### Benefits
- âœ… **Component Isolation**: Each component maintains its own styles
- âœ… **Automatic Loading**: CSS injects when component mounts
- âœ… **No External Dependencies**: No separate CSS files to manage
- âœ… **Obsidian Compatibility**: Works with plugin loading mechanism
- âœ… **Maintainable Architecture**: Styles stay with their components

### Files Modified
- âœ… `esbuild.config.mjs` - Fixed CSS injection configuration
- âœ… `src/components/DeckListPanel.svelte` - Restored component styles
- âœ… `src/main.ts` - Removed temporary global CSS injection

### Result
The DeckListPanel now displays correctly with proper component-scoped CSS injection, maintaining clean architecture while ensuring reliable styling!
